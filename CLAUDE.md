## Article Guidelines

See `ARTICLE_GUIDELINES.md` for full details. Read it before creating or substantially editing any article.

**Key points:**
- Articles cover **techniques, concepts, or ideas** — not papers
- When asked to "add an article about Paper X," extract the underlying concepts; a paper may yield zero, one, or multiple articles
- Tone: direct, academically rigorous but accessible, uses "we" inclusively
- Structure: motivation first, concrete examples before abstractions, blockquote definitions, sidenotes for tangents, "Pause and Think" sections for engagement

## When to read ARTICLE_GUIDELINES.md

- Creating a new article
- Editing article content (not just typos)
- User asks about article style, tone, or structure
- Deciding whether something should be an article

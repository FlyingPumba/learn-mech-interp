<objective>
Research inspiring documentation/learning sites, collaborate with user to identify preferred aesthetics, then apply those learnings to refine the visual design.

Purpose: Create a visual identity that the user loves by exploring reference sites together and extracting specific design elements that resonate.
Output: Updated CSS reflecting the collaboratively chosen aesthetic.

<tasks>

<task type="checkpoint:design-exploration" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 1: Design inspiration exploration</name>
  <action>
Present reference sites to the user one category at a time. For each site:

1. Fetch the site and describe its visual characteristics:
   - Color palette (warm/cool, light/dark, accent colors)
   - Typography style (serif/sans, size, weight)
   - Layout approach (wide/narrow, margins, whitespace)
   - Header/navigation style
   - Overall feel (academic, modern, playful, minimal)

2. Ask the user specific questions:
   - "Do you like the color palette here?"
   - "How do you feel about the typography weight/style?"
   - "Is this level of whitespace appealing?"
   - "Does the header feel right for our site?"

3. Take notes on preferences:
   - Colors they like
   - Typography approaches they prefer
   - Layout elements that resonate
   - Things they explicitly don't want

Start with 3-4 sites from different categories, then narrow down based on feedback.
  </action>
  <checkpoint_questions>
After showing sites, synthesize findings:
- "Based on what you've seen, you seem to prefer [X]. Is that right?"
- "Should we go more toward [Site A] or [Site B] direction?"
- "Any specific elements you'd like to combine from different sites?"
  </checkpoint_questions>

  <action>
Based on user's preferences from Task 1, update:

**variables.css:**
- Color palette reflecting chosen aesthetic
- Typography scale with better proportions
- Spacing that matches preferred whitespace level

**base.css:**
- Heading styles matching chosen feel
- Link and interaction styles
- Code block styling consistent with aesthetic

Document which reference sites influenced each choice.

  <what-built>
Visual design refined based on collaborative research:
- Color palette inspired by [chosen references]
- Typography style from [chosen references]
- Component styling matching aesthetic direction
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Refresh the dev server
2. Compare to the reference sites we discussed
3. Check that it captures the elements you liked
4. Verify nothing feels off or inconsistent
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if the visual design matches your vision, or describe adjustments needed</resume-signal>

<success_criteria>
- Visual aesthetic reflects user's explicit preferences from research phase
- Site feels cohesive and intentionally designed
- Typography is well-proportioned
- Colors feel harmonious
- Header/footer match the chosen style direction
- User is happy with the result
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/02-template-system-and-design/02-03-SUMMARY.md` including:
- Reference sites that influenced the design
- Specific elements borrowed from each
- User preferences documented for future reference

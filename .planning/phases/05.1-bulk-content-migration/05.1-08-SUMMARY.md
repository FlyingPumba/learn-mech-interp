  - "Concept-erasure and function-vectors kept to 1,000-1,500 words as narrower topics"
  - "Refusal direction article given most depth as the key safety case study of the block"

  - "Dual-use framing: every steering capability paired with its vulnerability implications"

# Phase 5.1 Plan 08: Block 5 Representation Engineering Summary

**5 articles covering the full representation engineering toolkit (ActAdd, CAA, RepE, refusal direction, LEACE, function vectors) with 3 Week 12 diagrams and dual-use safety framing**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 5min 17s
- **Started:** 2026-02-04T15:14:56Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-04T15:20:13Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files created:** 8

## Accomplishments
- Created activation-engineering article covering ActAdd and CAA with steering comparison diagram
- Created representation-engineering article covering the RepE paradigm (LAT reading and representation control)
- Created refusal-direction article with 2 diagrams covering the full ablation/addition experiment and safety implications
- Created concept-erasure article covering LEACE as the mathematically guaranteed complement to steering
- Created function-vectors article covering naturally occurring task directions vs engineered ones
- All 5 articles have block: "representation-engineering", completing Block 5

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create activation-engineering and representation-engineering articles** - `470d22c` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Create refusal-direction, concept-erasure, and function-vectors articles** - `55c342b` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `src/topics/activation-engineering/index.md` - ActAdd and CAA steering methods article (~1,800 words)
- `src/topics/activation-engineering/images/steering_method_comparison.png` - Method comparison diagram from Week 12
- `src/topics/representation-engineering/index.md` - RepE paradigm article (~1,700 words)
- `src/topics/refusal-direction/index.md` - Refusal direction case study article (~2,000 words)
- `src/topics/refusal-direction/images/refusal_direction_schematic.png` - Refusal direction schematic from Week 12
- `src/topics/refusal-direction/images/refusal_ablation_results.png` - Ablation results bar chart from Week 12
- `src/topics/concept-erasure/index.md` - LEACE concept erasure article (~1,200 words)
- `src/topics/function-vectors/index.md` - Function vectors article (~1,200 words)

## Decisions Made
- Narrative arc follows steering methods -> framework -> case study -> erasure -> natural directions, building progressively
- Refusal direction given the most depth as the key safety case study with both ablation and addition experiments
- Concept-erasure and function-vectors kept shorter as narrower topics (1,000-1,500 words each)
- Dual-use framing applied throughout: every steering capability explicitly paired with its vulnerability implications
- Cross-references between all 5 articles create a cohesive block narrative

## Deviations from Plan

None -- plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## User Setup Required

None -- no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Block 5 (Representation Engineering) complete with 5 articles and 3 diagrams
- All articles build-verified via `npx @11ty/eleventy --dryrun`
- References used: turner2024steering, panickssery2024caa, zou2023repe, arditi2024refusal, todd2024function, belrose2023leace (all pre-existing in references.json from Plan 01)

<objective>
Create all 4 articles in Block 8 (Open Problems & Field Assessment) from Week 16: open-problems-methods, field-assessment, future-directions, and course-synthesis.

Purpose: Block 8 is the capstone that surveys open problems, assesses the field, looks ahead, and synthesizes the full course. The synthesis article ties everything together.
Output: 4 new articles + 2 diagrams from Week 16.

```bash
mkdir -p src/topics/open-problems-methods/images
cp /Users/ivan/latex/mech-interp-course/week-16/assets/open_problems_taxonomy.png src/topics/open-problems-methods/images/
```

Create `src/topics/open-problems-methods/index.md` from Week 16 sections 2-4. Cover:

- Open Problems: Methods and Foundations
  - Decomposition: better ways to break models into interpretable units
  - Description: better ways to characterize what features/circuits do
  - Validation: better ways to verify interpretability claims
- Concrete Research Questions (from Nanda's 200 Open Problems):
  - Circuits in the wild: finding circuits for diverse behaviors
  - Interpreting algorithmic problems: understanding model reasoning
  - Exploring superposition: open questions about feature geometry
  - Techniques and tooling: what MI needs from better tools
  - Studying learned features: understanding feature properties
- Place the open problems taxonomy diagram

Front matter:
```yaml
title: "Open Problems in Mechanistic Interpretability: Methods"
description: "A survey of the most pressing open problems in MI methods -- from better decomposition and description to validation -- with concrete research questions from the field."
prerequisites:
  - title: "Honest Limitations of MI for Safety"
    url: "/topics/mi-safety-limitations/"
difficulty: "advanced"
block: "open-problems-and-frontiers"
category: "core-concepts"
```

References: nanda2022openproblems, sharkey2025openproblems. Cross-link to key articles throughout (superposition, sparse-autoencoders, circuit-tracing, mi-safety-limitations).

**Article B: field-assessment**

Copy diagram:
```bash
mkdir -p src/topics/field-assessment/images
cp /Users/ivan/latex/mech-interp-course/week-16/assets/field_assessment_timeline.png src/topics/field-assessment/images/
```

Create `src/topics/field-assessment/index.md` from Week 16 sections 5-7. Cover:

- What MI Can Do: finding features, demonstrating causal effects, tracing circuits (with cross-links to the specific articles demonstrating each)
- What MI Cannot Do: global circuit descriptions, scalable verification, completeness guarantees, detecting natural deception
- The Criticism and the Response: Hendrycks' critique, DeepMind's pivot, Nanda's assessment, continued Anthropic investment
- A balanced view of where the field stands
- Place the field assessment timeline diagram

Front matter:
```yaml
title: "What MI Can and Cannot Do: A Field Assessment"
description: "A balanced assessment of the current state of mechanistic interpretability -- what the field has achieved, what remains beyond reach, and how the community responds to criticism."
prerequisites:
  - title: "Open Problems: Methods and Research Questions"
    url: "/topics/open-problems-methods/"
difficulty: "advanced"
block: "open-problems-and-frontiers"
category: "core-concepts"
```

References: rai2024practical. Cross-link broadly to articles that demonstrate MI successes and limitations.

Content guidelines for both: 1,500-2,500 words each, 2 pause-and-think, 2-4 sidenotes. These are reflective articles -- more prose, less math.

  </files>
  <action>
**Article A: future-directions**

Create `src/topics/future-directions/index.md` from Week 16 sections 8-9. Cover:

- Research Frontiers:
  - Intrinsic interpretability: designing models that are interpretable by construction
  - Automated MI: using AI systems to interpret other AI systems at scale
  - Beyond transformers: extending MI to other architectures (state-space models, mixture-of-experts)
  - Formal verification: connecting MI to mathematical proofs of model behavior
  - Cognitive interpretability: bridging MI with cognitive science
- Career Paths and Getting Started: how to enter the MI research community, key resources, research groups

Front matter:
```yaml
title: "The Future of Mechanistic Interpretability"
description: "Research frontiers in MI -- from intrinsic interpretability and automated MI to formal verification -- and practical guidance for entering the field."
prerequisites:
  - title: "What MI Can and Cannot Do"
    url: "/topics/field-assessment/"
difficulty: "advanced"
block: "open-problems-and-frontiers"
category: "core-concepts"
```

Cross-link to circuit-tracing (automated MI extends this), sparse-autoencoders (foundation for current approaches).

**Article B: course-synthesis**

Create `src/topics/course-synthesis/index.md` from Week 16 section 10. Cover:

- The Core Insight: what the entire course teaches about how neural networks work
- The Toolkit We Built: a brief tour of every major method covered (with cross-links to each article)
- What Remains: the gap between current tools and complete understanding
- The Honest Assessment: synthesizing the limitations discussion
- What You Now Know: empowering the reader with awareness of what they have learned

This is the capstone article. It should reference and cross-link to articles across all 8 blocks, providing the reader with a comprehensive map of what they have learned. It functions as both a conclusion and a "start here for an overview" entry point.

Front matter:
```yaml
title: "Course Synthesis: From Transformers to Interpretability"
description: "A capstone synthesis of the full mechanistic interpretability curriculum -- the core insights, the toolkit, the limitations, and what comes next."
prerequisites:
  - title: "The Future of Mechanistic Interpretability"
    url: "/topics/future-directions/"
difficulty: "advanced"
block: "open-problems-and-frontiers"
category: "core-concepts"
```

Cross-link broadly: attention-mechanism, superposition, activation-patching, sparse-autoencoders, circuit-tracing, refusal-direction, mi-safety-limitations (at minimum).

Content guidelines: future-directions target 1,500-2,000 words. course-synthesis target 1,500-2,500 words. 2 pause-and-think each, 2-4 sidenotes. Reflective, synthesizing tone. Minimal math -- these are narrative articles.

# Phase 5.1 Plan 06: Block 4 Part 1 -- Superposition and SAEs Summary

SAE architecture article with dictionary learning framing, architecture equations in KaTeX, training methodology, and Towards Monosemanticity results; plus feature dashboards and automated interpretability article covering the inspection methodology for SAE features.

## Tasks Completed

| Task | Name | Commit | Key Files |
|------|------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Review superposition pilot + create sparse-autoencoders article | 81b0c16 | superposition/index.md, sparse-autoencoders/index.md, sae_architecture.png |
| 2 | Create sae-interpretability article | bf8041f | sae-interpretability/index.md |

## What Was Done

### Task 1: Review superposition pilot + create sparse-autoencoders article

**Part A: Superposition pilot review.** Compared the existing pilot at `src/topics/superposition/index.md` against the Week 9 Typst source. The pilot covers all required content: the fundamental tension (counting problem, two strategies), the toy model (architecture, experimental knobs, loss function), phase diagrams (importance-sparsity tradeoff, phase transitions), geometry of superposition (all polytopes: 2D orthogonal, 1D antipodal, 2D triangle, 2D pentagon, 3D octahedron), interference and its cost, and why superposition makes interpretability hard. All 6 PNG diagrams are referenced, with alt text and captions. Has 2 pause-and-think prompts and 2 sidenotes. Front matter has `block: "superposition-and-feature-extraction"`. Only change: added forward cross-link `[sparse autoencoders](/topics/sparse-autoencoders/)` in the final paragraph.

**Part B: Sparse-autoencoders article.** Created from Week 10 Typst sections 2-5. Covers:
- **From Superposition to Dictionary Learning:** the mathematical framing connecting superposition (the problem) to dictionary learning (the solution), why sparsity makes recovery possible, why "weak" dictionary learning is preferred
- **The SAE Architecture:** encoder equation, decoder equation, loss function with reconstruction and L1 sparsity terms, the sparsity-reconstruction tradeoff
- **Training SAEs:** training on model activations (not text), design decisions (expansion factor, where to apply, training data volume)
- **Towards Monosemanticity Results:** one-layer transformer experiment, 512 neurons to 4,000+ features, example features, 70% interpretability rate, four lines of evidence

Includes SAE architecture diagram copied from course assets. Has 2 pause-and-think prompts, 4 sidenotes, 1 blockquote definition. Forward links to sae-interpretability and scaling-monosemanticity.

### Task 2: Create sae-interpretability article

Created from Week 10 Typst sections 6-7. Covers:
- **What Monosemantic Features Look Like:** examples of specific SAE features (Arabic script, DNA, legal language, etc.)
- **Feature Dashboards:** the three-component inspection tool (activation examples, logit effects, ablation impact)
- **How to Read a Dashboard:** positive evidence patterns and warning signs (mixed activations, inconsistent logits, minimal ablation)
- **Automated Interpretability:** the LLM-based pipeline for scaling feature evaluation
- **The Promise and Limits:** overly broad descriptions, interpretability illusion concern, need for multiple evaluation methods

Has 2 pause-and-think prompts, 4 sidenotes, 1 blockquote definition. Forward links to scaling-monosemanticity and sae-variants-and-evaluation.

## Decisions Made

1. **Superposition pilot confirmed complete** -- no substantive changes needed beyond adding the forward cross-link. The pilot faithfully covers all Week 9 content.
2. **SAE article follows problem-solution arc** -- starts with the dictionary learning framing that connects superposition to SAEs before introducing the architecture.
3. **Feature inspection methodology separated** -- sae-interpretability is its own article per learningPath.json, keeping the SAE architecture article focused.

## Deviations from Plan

None -- plan executed exactly as written.

## Verification

- [x] `npx @11ty/eleventy --dryrun` succeeds with no errors
- [x] Superposition pilot confirmed complete with forward link to sparse-autoencoders
- [x] sparse-autoencoders article has SAE architecture diagram placed with alt text and caption
- [x] sae-interpretability article covers feature dashboards and automated interpretation
- [x] All 3 articles have `block: "superposition-and-feature-extraction"`

## Next Phase Readiness

Plan 07 (Block 4 Part 2) can proceed. It will create scaling-monosemanticity and sae-variants-and-evaluation articles, continuing the narrative arc from these articles. Both new articles include forward links to those upcoming topics.

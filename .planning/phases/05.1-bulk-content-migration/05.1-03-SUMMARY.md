# Phase 5.1 Plan 03: Block 2 Part 1 -- Foundations of MI Summary

**Three foundational MI articles covering the interpretability landscape, linear representation hypothesis, polysemanticity, induction head discovery, and the phase change phenomenon**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 4min 46s
- **Started:** 2026-02-04T15:14:25Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-04T15:19:11Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files created:** 3

## Accomplishments
- Created what-is-mech-interp article: black-box vs white-box, post-hoc vs intrinsic, correlation vs causation, three claims (features, circuits, universality), safety motivation (~1,800 words)
- Created linear-representation-hypothesis article: LRH stated and motivated, why linear (architectural argument), empirical evidence, connection to superposition, polysemanticity (~1,800 words)
- Created induction-heads article: one-layer model limitations, two-layer composition, the induction head two-step mechanism, attention pattern signatures, phase change, scaling to large models (~1,980 words)

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create what-is-mech-interp and linear-representation-hypothesis** - `e113c60` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Create induction-heads** - `b567ac9` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `src/topics/what-is-mech-interp/index.md` - Interpretability landscape, three claims, safety motivation
- `src/topics/linear-representation-hypothesis/index.md` - LRH, why linear, polysemanticity, superposition connection
- `src/topics/induction-heads/index.md` - Induction head discovery, two-step mechanism, phase change

## Content Verification

| Article | Words | Pause-and-Think | Sidenotes | Citations | Block |
|---------|-------|-----------------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| what-is-mech-interp | ~1,800 | 2 | 3 | 2 (bereska2024review, olah2020zoom) | foundations-of-mi |
| linear-representation-hypothesis | ~1,800 | 2 | 4 | 2 (park2023lrh, olah2020zoom) | foundations-of-mi |
| induction-heads | ~1,980 | 2 | 4 | 3 (elhage2021mathematical, olsson2022context) | foundations-of-mi |

## Cross-Link Structure
- what-is-mech-interp -> attention-mechanism (prerequisite), linear-representation-hypothesis (forward), superposition (forward), induction-heads (forward)
- linear-representation-hypothesis -> what-is-mech-interp (prerequisite), superposition (forward), induction-heads (forward)
- induction-heads -> composition-and-virtual-heads (prerequisite), direct-logit-attribution (forward), ioi-circuit (forward)

## Decisions Made
- what-is-mech-interp uses attention-mechanism as sole prerequisite since it is the foundational entry to the MI block
- linear-representation-hypothesis uses what-is-mech-interp as prerequisite for sequential reading order within the block
- induction-heads uses composition-and-virtual-heads as prerequisite (requires understanding of K-composition)
- Kept the AI safety motivation section brief in what-is-mech-interp, deferring deeper treatment to Block 7 (MI for Safety)
- Presented the induction head discovery as a narrative story rather than a technical derivation, following research notes recommendation

## Deviations from Plan

None -- plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## User Setup Required

None -- no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Three Block 2 Part 1 articles complete and building successfully
- Ready for Plan 04 (Block 2 Part 2: direct-logit-attribution, logit-lens-and-probing) to continue the Foundations of MI block
- Cross-links to not-yet-created articles (composition-and-virtual-heads, direct-logit-attribution, ioi-circuit, sparse-autoencoders) will resolve as those articles are created

<objective>
Complete Block 6: create the open-problems article from Week 16, the final article in the learning path.

Purpose: This capstone article surveys the open problems and future directions of MI research. It synthesizes themes from the entire course and points readers toward active research frontiers. As the final article in the learning path, it should feel like a satisfying conclusion that motivates further study.
Output: 1 article with 2 diagrams

Convert week-16.typ (1077 lines) into a narrative article. Week 16 covers:

1. **Taxonomy of Open Problems** - Organizing the unsolved problems in MI by category: understanding individual components, understanding circuits, understanding training dynamics, bridging to safety, scaling to frontier models.

2. **Concrete Research Directions** - Drawing from Nanda's "200 Concrete Open Problems" and Sharkey et al.'s "Open Problems in MI." Specific tractable problems that new researchers could work on. Examples: understanding MLP layers, improving SAEs, finding universal circuits, automated circuit discovery.

3. **Field Assessment** - Where MI stands as a field in 2024-2025. What has been achieved (toy models, small circuits, SAEs, initial scaling). What remains (frontier model understanding, safety guarantees, automation). The pace of progress and key milestones.

4. **The Path Forward** - How MI might develop. The role of automation (LLM-assisted MI). Scaling challenges. Integration with other alignment approaches. What success would look like.

5. **Getting Involved** - Resources for readers who want to contribute. Research groups, open-source tools, reading lists, community forums. How this course prepares readers for MI research.

Content guidelines:
- Cite: nanda2022openproblems, sharkey2025openproblems (both in references.json)
- Also cite: bereska2024review, rai2024practical (broader surveys)
- This is the final article in the learning path. It should reference and synthesize themes from across the entire course. Include cross-links to many earlier articles where specific open problems relate to topics already covered.
- 2 pause-and-think prompts (e.g., "Which open problem do you find most tractable?" or "What would it take for MI to provide safety guarantees?")
- 2-4 sidenotes
- Cross-link to: what-is-mech-interp (MI goals), superposition (feature understanding), sparse-autoencoders (SAE improvements), circuit-tracing (scaling circuits), mi-safety (safety motivation)
- Target 1,500-2,500 words
- The tone should be forward-looking and motivating, inviting readers to contribute to MI research

  <verify>Run `npx @11ty/eleventy`. Verify open-problems appears in sidebar under "Synthesis & Open Frontiers" (after mi-safety). Check both images render. Verify citations resolve. Check cross-links to earlier articles work.</verify>
  <done>open-problems article exists with 2 diagrams covering open problem taxonomy, field assessment, research directions, and path forward. Multiple cross-links to earlier articles. All citations work. Article serves as a satisfying capstone.</done>

1. `npx @11ty/eleventy` builds without errors
2. open-problems appears in sidebar under "Synthesis & Open Frontiers" (second/last topic in block)
3. Both PNGs render with alt text and captions
4. No KaTeX errors, no [??] citation markers
5. Cross-links to earlier articles (what-is-mech-interp, superposition, sparse-autoencoders, circuit-tracing, mi-safety) all work
6. This is the last article in prev/next navigation -- "next" should not exist or should link to a "course complete" summary

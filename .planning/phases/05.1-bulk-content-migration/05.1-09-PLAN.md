<objective>
Create all 5 articles in Block 6 (Circuit Tracing & Comparative MI) from Weeks 13-14: transcoders, circuit-tracing, crosscoders-and-model-diffing, universality, and multimodal-mi.

Purpose: Block 6 covers the frontier of circuit analysis using SAE features, and extends MI beyond single text models to comparisons across models and modalities.
Output: 5 new articles + 5 diagrams from Weeks 13-14.

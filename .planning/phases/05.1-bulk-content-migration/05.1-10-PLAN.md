<objective>
Cross-link audit and final verification across all 16 articles.

Purpose: Wave 2 plans wrote articles independently. This plan verifies consistency across the full article set: cross-links resolve, citations work, navigation flows correctly, and no content gaps exist.
Output: All cross-links verified and fixed. Build passes cleanly. Full site is a coherent learning resource.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Audit and fix cross-article links</name>
  <files>All src/topics/*/index.md files</files>
  <action>
For each of the 16 articles (excluding test), scan for all cross-article links (patterns matching `/topics/SLUG/` or `/topics/SLUG/#anchor`).

For each link found:
1. Verify the target article exists at the expected path
2. Verify any section anchor matches an actual heading in the target article (slugify the heading text with @sindresorhus/slugify rules: lowercase, hyphens for spaces)
3. Fix broken links

Also check for MISSING cross-links -- articles that reference concepts from other articles without linking. Specifically:
- Every article that mentions "superposition" should link to /topics/superposition/ at least once
- Every article that mentions "attention" mechanism concepts should link to /topics/attention-mechanism/
- Every article that mentions "SAE" or "sparse autoencoder" should link to /topics/sparse-autoencoders/
- Every article that mentions "activation patching" should link to /topics/activation-patching/

Add missing cross-links where they improve reader navigation. Do not over-link (first mention in a section is enough; subsequent mentions in the same section do not need repeated links).

Run a grep for common broken link patterns:
```bash
grep -rn '/topics/[a-z-]*/\|/topics/[a-z-]*/#' src/topics/*/index.md
```
Cross-reference against actual directory listing to find broken targets.
  </action>
  <verify>Run `npx @11ty/eleventy` and check build output for warnings. Grep all article files for cross-links and verify each target path exists. No broken internal links.</verify>
  <done>All cross-article links resolve to valid article paths. Section anchors match actual headings. Missing cross-links for key concepts have been added.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Verify citations, images, navigation, and build</name>
  <files>All src/topics/*/index.md files</files>
  <action>
**Citations audit:**
Grep all articles for `{% cite "` patterns. Extract all citation keys used. Cross-reference against references.json keys. Report any mismatches:
```bash
grep -oh 'cite "[^"]*"' src/topics/*/index.md | sort -u
```
Fix any citations referencing keys not in references.json (either add the reference or fix the key typo).

**Images audit:**
Verify all 27 PNGs exist at their expected paths:
```bash
ls src/topics/*/images/*.png
```
Cross-reference against the research's diagram placement plan. Ensure every placed image has:
- Descriptive alt text (not empty or generic)
- "Figure N:" prefix in the caption

**Navigation audit:**
Build the site and verify:
1. Sidebar shows 6 blocks with 16 topics in correct order
2. Prev/next links chain through all 16 articles in learningPath.json order
3. Breadcrumbs show correct Block > Topic for each article
4. Homepage learning path visualization shows all 6 blocks

Run: `npx @11ty/eleventy` and check for any build warnings or errors.

**Front matter audit:**
For each article, verify these fields exist and are valid:
- title (non-empty string)
- description (non-empty string)
- prerequisites (array, can be empty for foundational articles)
- difficulty (one of: foundational, intermediate, advanced)
- block (matches a block slug in learningPath.json)
- category (one of: core-concepts, methods, applications)

Fix any issues found.
  </action>
  <verify>Run `npx @11ty/eleventy` -- must complete with no errors. Run `grep -c 'cite "[^"]*"' src/topics/*/index.md` to verify citation counts. Run `ls src/topics/*/images/*.png | wc -l` to verify image count (should be 27). Run `node -e "const lp = require('./src/_data/learningPath.json'); lp.blocks.forEach(b => b.topics.forEach(t => { try { require('fs').accessSync('src/topics/' + t.slug + '/index.md'); } catch(e) { console.log('MISSING:', t.slug); } }))"` to verify all learningPath topics have articles.</verify>
  <done>All citations resolve. All 27 images placed with alt text and captions. Sidebar, prev/next, and breadcrumbs work correctly. All front matter is valid. Eleventy builds without errors.</done>
</task>

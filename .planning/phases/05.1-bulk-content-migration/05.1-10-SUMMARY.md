# Plan 05.1-10: Block 7 MI for Safety Summary

**4 articles covering MI safety applications (sleeper agents, deception detection, safety mechanisms, honest limitations) with 3 diagrams, trained-vs-natural caveat, and 6 distinct limitations in the scorecard article**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 6 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-04T15:15:09Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-04T15:21:08Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files created:** 7

## Accomplishments
- Created sleeper-agent-detection article covering threat model, backdoor persistence through safety training, defection probes with >99% AUROC, and the critical trained-vs-natural deception limitation
- Created deception-detection article covering alignment faking (Greenblatt et al.), why behavioral evaluations fail by design, internal probe success at 98%, and SAE failure as deception detectors
- Created safety-mechanisms-and-monitoring article covering refusal direction recap, model organisms for misalignment, dual-use tension, sabotage evaluations, attribution graph inspection, and monitoring limitations
- Created mi-safety-limitations article with 6 distinct honest limitations: interpretability illusions, non-identifiability, SAEs discarding safety info, scalability, per-input vs global understanding, dual-use problem
- Placed 3 diagrams from Week 15 assets across the block

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create sleeper-agent-detection and deception-detection articles** - `1f8d661` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Create safety-mechanisms-and-monitoring and mi-safety-limitations articles** - `587f690` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `src/topics/sleeper-agent-detection/index.md` - Sleeper agent threat model, defection probes, trained-vs-natural caveat
- `src/topics/sleeper-agent-detection/images/sleeper_agent_detection.png` - Detection pipeline diagram
- `src/topics/deception-detection/index.md` - Alignment faking, behavioral eval failure, SAE failure for deception
- `src/topics/safety-mechanisms-and-monitoring/index.md` - Refusal direction recap, model organisms, sabotage evals, monitoring
- `src/topics/safety-mechanisms-and-monitoring/images/safety_applications_overview.png` - Four safety applications overview
- `src/topics/safety-mechanisms-and-monitoring/images/mi_safety_assessment.png` - MI safety assessment scorecard
- `src/topics/mi-safety-limitations/index.md` - 6 honest limitations with the gap analysis and Swiss cheese model

## Decisions Made
- Promise-then-limitation pairing: each safety application article includes both positive results and explicit caveats within the same article, never separating success from limitation
- mi-safety-limitations organized as 6 numbered limitations rather than thematic groupings, for directness and clarity
- SAE failure for deception detection covered substantially in the deception-detection article (where the evidence is presented), then referenced as a general limitation in mi-safety-limitations (where it fits the pattern of SAE limitations across safety)
- The "gap" section in mi-safety-limitations includes three perspectives (Amodei optimist, Nanda pragmatist, Hendrycks critic) as a sidenote to provide balance without dominating the article

## Deviations from Plan

None -- plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## User Setup Required

None -- no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Block 7 (MI for AI Safety) complete with all 4 articles
- Cross-links forward to open-problems-methods (Block 8) are in place
- Build succeeds with all new articles

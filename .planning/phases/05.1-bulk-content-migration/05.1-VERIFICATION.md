# Phase 5.1: Bulk Content Migration Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** All 16 weeks of Typst course content converted into thematic long-form articles, reorganized by topic rather than by week, with all diagrams, paper references, cross-article links, and front matter -- making the site a complete MI learning resource covering the full curriculum.
**Verified:** 2026-02-04T15:41:59Z **Status:** PASSED

## Observable Truths: 7/7 VERIFIED

1. All 16 weeks converted into 35 long-form articles by theme: VERIFIED (35 dirs, 74-211 lines each, narrative prose)
2. All 27 diagrams placed with alt text and figure captions: VERIFIED (27 PNGs across 16 article dirs)
3. All paper references in references.json and cited throughout: VERIFIED (44 refs, 94 cite shortcodes across 32 articles)
4. learningPath.json has 8 blocks, 35 topics; sidebar/homepage wired: VERIFIED (all slugs match, templates iterate blocks)
5. Cross-article links connect concepts across full article set: VERIFIED (210 cross-refs, every article has 2+ links)
6. Each article has complete front matter and all content types: VERIFIED (title, desc, prereqs, difficulty, block, category; 121 sidenotes, 72 pause-and-think)
7. Pilot articles expanded to cover full week content: VERIFIED (superposition 160 lines/6 PNGs, activation-patching 182 lines/3 PNGs)

## Required Artifacts: All VERIFIED

- src/_data/references.json: 44 entries, 310 lines, valid JSON
- src/_data/learningPath.json: 8 blocks, 35 topics, 87 lines, valid JSON
- src/topics/*/index.md: 35 article dirs, 74-211 lines each, zero stubs
- src/topics/*/images/*.png: 27 PNGs in 16 article dirs
- eleventy.config.js: cite (line 81) and sidenote (line 101) shortcodes wired
- src/_includes/layouts/article.njk: 72 lines, breadcrumbs/nav/TOC
- src/_includes/partials/sidebar.njk: 19 lines, iterates all blocks/topics
- src/index.njk: 61 lines, full learning path on homepage

## Key Links: All WIRED

- learningPath.json -> sidebar.njk via Nunjucks for loop: WIRED
- learningPath.json -> index.njk via Nunjucks for loop: WIRED
- references.json -> cite shortcodes via eleventy.config.js: WIRED
- Article block: field -> navigation hierarchy via topics.11tydata.js: WIRED
- Article block: field -> breadcrumbs via article.njk: WIRED
- collections.learningPath -> prev/next navigation via article.njk: WIRED

## Anti-Patterns: NONE in real articles (only test/index.md has placeholder.png -- expected)

## Human Verification Required

1. Visual Rendering: Build site, check KaTeX math, images, sidenotes, tooltips in browser
2. Navigation Flow: Verify sidebar shows all 35 topics, prev/next works, Start Learning link correct
3. Cross-Article Links: Click 5-6 cross-links from articles, verify no 404s

## Gaps Summary

No gaps found. All 7 observable truths verified. Phase goal achieved.

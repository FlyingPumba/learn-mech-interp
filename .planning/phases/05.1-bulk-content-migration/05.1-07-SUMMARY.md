# Phase 5.1 Plan 07: Block 4 Part 2 Summary

**Scaling monosemanticity (Golden Gate Claude, safety features) and SAE variants (Gated/TopK/JumpReLU) with SAEBench evaluation and 5 honest limitations -- completing Block 4**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 4min 29s
- **Started:** 2026-02-04T15:14:55Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-04T15:19:24Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files created:** 2

## Accomplishments

- Created scaling-monosemanticity article covering the jump from 4,096 features to 34 million, multilingual/multimodal features, scaling laws, Golden Gate Claude feature clamping, and safety-relevant features with honest assessment of open questions
- Created sae-variants-and-evaluation article covering the L1 shrinkage problem, three SAE variants as an evolution story, SAEBench evaluation showing proxy metrics don't predict practical performance, and five limitations (absorption, splitting, dead features, non-uniqueness, interpretability illusions)
- Block 4 (Superposition & Feature Extraction) now complete with all 5 articles

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create scaling-monosemanticity article** - `d6a51cc` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Create sae-variants-and-evaluation article** - `5358288` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/topics/scaling-monosemanticity/index.md` - Scaling SAEs to Claude 3 Sonnet, Golden Gate Claude, safety-relevant features (~2,200 words)
- `src/topics/sae-variants-and-evaluation/index.md` - SAE variants, SAEBench, honest limitations (~2,400 words)

## Decisions Made

- Golden Gate Claude story given full section with technical mechanism (feature clamping equation) rather than just a mention, since it is the most vivid demonstration of causal feature steering
- SAE variants presented as iterative improvement story (from L1 proxy to direct L0 optimization) rather than a catalog of architectures, following the pedagogical guidance from RESEARCH.md
- Five limitations covered in depth: absorption gets the most space as a structural consequence of sparsity optimization; interpretability illusions get a worked example showing how a "deception feature" might actually be "social interaction"
- Safety section explicitly frames applications as "promising directions, not accomplished facts" with three open questions
- Cross-link from scaling-monosemanticity forward to sae-variants-and-evaluation; cross-link from sae-variants-and-evaluation forward to transcoders and circuit-tracing

## Deviations from Plan

None -- plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## User Setup Required

None -- no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Block 4 complete: superposition, sparse-autoencoders, sae-interpretability (Plan 06), scaling-monosemanticity, sae-variants-and-evaluation all in place
- Forward links to transcoders and circuit-tracing (Plan 09) ready
- Forward link to activation-engineering (Plan 08) ready from scaling-monosemanticity's feature steering discussion
- All citations reference keys in references.json

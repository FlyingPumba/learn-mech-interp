# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 05.1-bulk-content-migration
    provides: "references.json (44 entries), learningPath.json (8 blocks, 35 topics)"
provides:
  - "4 Block 8 articles: open-problems-methods, field-assessment, future-directions, course-synthesis"
  - "2 diagrams: open_problems_taxonomy.png, field_assessment_timeline.png"
  - "capstone article with cross-links spanning all 8 blocks"
affects: ["05.1-12 if it exists", "phase-06 or later"]

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - "Reflective article pattern: more prose, less math, survey/synthesis style"
    - "Capstone cross-linking: course-synthesis links to 11 articles across 7 blocks"

key-decisions:
  - "All 4 articles are reflective/narrative -- minimal math, focus on prose synthesis"
  - "course-synthesis cross-links to 11 articles across 7 blocks (exceeds minimum of 5)"
  - "field-assessment presents Hendrycks critique at full strength before the response"

patterns-established:
  - "Capstone cross-linking: final article ties entire curriculum together"
  - "Balanced assessment pattern: paired strengths/limitations throughout"

# Phase 5.1 Plan 11: Block 8 Open Problems and Field Assessment Summary

**4 capstone articles completing Block 8 (open-problems-and-frontiers) with taxonomy/timeline diagrams and course-synthesis cross-linking 11 articles across 7 blocks**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 6min 14s
- **Started:** 2026-02-04T15:15:25Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-04T15:21:39Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files created:** 6

## Accomplishments
- Created all 4 Block 8 articles from Week 16 source material
- Copied 2 diagrams (open_problems_taxonomy.png, field_assessment_timeline.png) with alt text and captions
- course-synthesis capstone article cross-links to 11 articles spanning all 8 blocks
- All 35 articles now exist across all 8 blocks (3 reviewed pilots + 32 new)

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create open-problems-methods and field-assessment articles** - `168e1fd` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Create future-directions and course-synthesis articles** - `316d891` (feat)

**Plan metadata:** [pending] (docs: complete plan)

## Files Created/Modified
- `src/topics/open-problems-methods/index.md` - Open problems survey: decomposition, description, validation, concrete research questions
- `src/topics/open-problems-methods/images/open_problems_taxonomy.png` - Three-category taxonomy diagram from Sharkey et al.
- `src/topics/field-assessment/index.md` - Balanced field assessment: MI capabilities, limitations, Hendrycks critique, pragmatic consensus
- `src/topics/field-assessment/images/field_assessment_timeline.png` - MI milestones timeline (2020-2026)
- `src/topics/future-directions/index.md` - Five research frontiers and career paths
- `src/topics/course-synthesis/index.md` - Capstone synthesis with 12 cross-links across 7 blocks

## Decisions Made
- All 4 articles use reflective/narrative style with minimal math, matching the plan's "more prose, less math" guidance
- course-synthesis cross-links to attention-mechanism, superposition, activation-patching, sparse-autoencoders, circuit-tracing, refusal-direction, mi-safety-limitations, activation-engineering, field-assessment, future-directions, open-problems-methods (11 articles)
- field-assessment presents the Hendrycks critique at full strength before the response, matching the source material's balanced assessment approach

## Deviations from Plan

None -- plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
None

## User Setup Required
None -- no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- All 35 articles now exist across all 8 blocks
- Block 8 (open-problems-and-frontiers) complete with all 4 articles
- Full course content migration complete, ready for any remaining plans or next phase

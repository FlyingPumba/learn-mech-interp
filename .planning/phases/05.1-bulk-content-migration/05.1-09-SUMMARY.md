# Plan 09: Block 6 Circuit Tracing and Comparative MI Summary

**5 articles covering feature-level circuit tracing (transcoders, attribution graphs), model comparison (crosscoders, universality), and multimodal MI extension (CLIP, VLMs, diffusion) with 5 diagrams from Weeks 13-14**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 7min 1s
- **Started:** 2026-02-04T15:15:13Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-04T15:22:14Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files created:** 10 (5 articles + 5 diagrams)

## Accomplishments
- Created transcoders article covering MLP problem, transcoder architecture, clean factorization, and comparison with SAEs
- Created circuit-tracing article covering sparse feature circuits (Marks et al.), attribution graphs (Lindsey et al.), Biology paper case studies, and the evolution from head-level to feature-level circuits
- Created crosscoders-and-model-diffing article covering model diffing methodology, shared/exclusive features, L1 artifacts, and BatchTopK fix
- Created universality article covering CKA, SVCCA, three dimensions of universality, weak vs strong universality
- Created multimodal-mi article covering CLIP interpretability, VLMs, diffusion model temporal evolution, and honest assessment of the field
- All 5 articles follow block narrative arc: tools -> methodology -> comparison -> extension

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create transcoders and circuit-tracing articles with 3 diagrams** - `7586902` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Create crosscoders, universality, and multimodal-mi articles with 2 diagrams** - `282fcfb` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `src/topics/transcoders/index.md` - Transcoder architecture, SAE comparison, clean factorization, circuit analysis enablement
- `src/topics/transcoders/images/transcoder_vs_sae.png` - SAE vs transcoder architecture diagram
- `src/topics/circuit-tracing/index.md` - Sparse feature circuits, attribution graphs, Biology paper case studies, circuit evolution
- `src/topics/circuit-tracing/images/attribution_graph_schematic.png` - Simplified attribution graph diagram
- `src/topics/circuit-tracing/images/circuit_evolution.png` - Timeline of circuit analysis generations
- `src/topics/crosscoders-and-model-diffing/index.md` - Crosscoder architecture, model diffing, shared/exclusive features, limitations
- `src/topics/crosscoders-and-model-diffing/images/crosscoder_model_diffing.png` - Crosscoder model diffing architecture diagram
- `src/topics/universality/index.md` - CKA/SVCCA metrics, training/scale/architecture universality, weak vs strong
- `src/topics/universality/images/universality_evidence.png` - Three dimensions of universality diagram
- `src/topics/multimodal-mi/index.md` - CLIP interpretability, VLMs, diffusion models, honest assessment

## Decisions Made
- Transcoders article uses the SAE-vs-transcoder distinction as the primary teaching contrast, making the "representation vs computation" difference the central insight
- Circuit-tracing article covers both Marks et al. (sparse feature circuits) and Lindsey et al. (attribution graphs) in one article, showing the evolution from per-layer SAE features to cross-layer transcoders
- Universality article integrates CKA/SVCCA metrics directly rather than splitting into a separate article, since the metrics serve the universality discussion
- Multimodal MI article uses CLIP as the deep example (closest parallel to text SAE work) and surveys VLMs and diffusion models more briefly
- Crosscoders article does not use {% cite %} shortcode because the primary crosscoders paper (Lindsey et al. 2024) is an Anthropic blog post not in references.json; article references the work through inline discussion and cross-links

## Deviations from Plan

None -- plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## User Setup Required

None -- no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Block 6 (Circuit Tracing & Comparative MI) complete with 5 articles
- All articles build on Block 4 (Superposition & Feature Extraction) concepts, especially SAEs and feature steering
- Cross-links established to earlier content (sparse-autoencoders, activation-patching, ioi-circuit, superposition, refusal-direction)
- Ready for Block 7 (MI for AI Safety) and Block 8 (Open Problems) article creation

<objective>
Perform a comprehensive cross-link audit and final verification across all 35 articles, fixing broken links, missing cross-references, and front matter inconsistencies.

Purpose: After all articles are written in parallel by Plans 02-11, cross-references and consistency need verification. This plan catches any issues that could not be validated during parallel authoring.
Output: All 35 articles verified and consistent, ready for deployment.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Verify all articles, fix cross-links and front matter</name>
  <files>src/topics/*/index.md</files>
  <action>
Perform a systematic audit of all 35 articles:

**1. Existence check:** Verify all 35 topic directories exist and have an index.md:
```bash
for slug in attention-mechanism qk-ov-circuits composition-and-virtual-heads what-is-mech-interp linear-representation-hypothesis induction-heads direct-logit-attribution logit-lens-and-probing activation-patching attribution-patching ioi-circuit circuit-evaluation superposition sparse-autoencoders sae-interpretability scaling-monosemanticity sae-variants-and-evaluation activation-engineering representation-engineering refusal-direction concept-erasure function-vectors transcoders circuit-tracing crosscoders-and-model-diffing universality multimodal-mi sleeper-agent-detection deception-detection safety-mechanisms-and-monitoring mi-safety-limitations open-problems-methods field-assessment future-directions course-synthesis; do
  test -f "src/topics/$slug/index.md" && echo "OK: $slug" || echo "MISSING: $slug"
done
```

**2. learningPath.json sync:** Verify every slug in learningPath.json has a corresponding article and every article has its slug in learningPath.json.

**3. Front matter audit:** For each article, check:
- `title` is present and quoted
- `description` is present
- `prerequisites` array entries all point to existing articles (the `url` field resolves)
- `difficulty` is one of: foundational, intermediate, advanced
- `block` matches one of the 8 block slugs in learningPath.json
- `category` is present

**4. Cross-link audit:** Search all articles for internal links matching `/topics/SLUG/` and `/topics/SLUG/#anchor`. Verify each linked slug exists as an article. Fix any broken links.

**5. Citation audit:** Search all articles for `{% cite "KEY" %}` patterns. Verify each KEY exists in references.json. Fix any mismatched keys.

**6. Diagram audit:** Verify all 27 PNGs are placed:
- 3 in activation-patching/images/ (already from pilot)
- 6 in superposition/images/ (already from pilot)
- 3 in logit-lens-and-probing/images/
- 1 in ioi-circuit/images/ (referenced from circuit-evaluation)
- 1 in sparse-autoencoders/images/
- 1 in activation-engineering/images/
- 2 in refusal-direction/images/
- 1 in transcoders/images/
- 2 in circuit-tracing/images/
- 1 in crosscoders-and-model-diffing/images/
- 1 in universality/images/
- 1 in sleeper-agent-detection/images/
- 2 in safety-mechanisms-and-monitoring/images/
- 1 in open-problems-methods/images/
- 1 in field-assessment/images/

Verify each PNG is referenced in an article with `![alt text](...` syntax and includes a "Figure N:" caption.

**7. Content quality spot-check:** For 5 randomly selected new articles, verify:
- At least 2 pause-and-think prompts exist (`<details class="pause-and-think">`)
- At least 2 sidenotes exist (`{% sidenote`)
- No Typst syntax remnants (search for `#pause`, `#focus-slide`, `bb(`, `vx`, `$...$` with Typst-style subscripts)
- Prose reads as narrative (not bullet fragments)

Fix any issues found during the audit. If articles are missing substantial content, note them for follow-up.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npx @11ty/eleventy` (full build, not dryrun) and verify it completes without errors and produces output for all 35 articles. Check the output count:
```bash
ls _site/topics/*/index.html | wc -l
```
Expected: 36 (35 articles + 1 test article).
  </verify>
  <done>All 35 articles verified: front matter consistent, cross-links working, citations valid, diagrams placed, build succeeds producing 35 article pages.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add missing cross-links between blocks</name>
  <files>src/topics/*/index.md</files>
  <action>
After the audit in Task 1, add strategic cross-links that connect concepts across blocks. Focus on the key connections that help readers navigate:

**Cross-block links to ensure:**
1. Block 1 -> Block 2: attention-mechanism links to what-is-mech-interp ("Understanding the transformer is the first step toward [mechanistic interpretability](/topics/what-is-mech-interp/)")
2. Block 2 -> Block 3: logit-lens-and-probing links forward to activation-patching ("Observation alone cannot establish causation -- [activation patching](/topics/activation-patching/) addresses this")
3. Block 3 -> Block 4: circuit-evaluation links to superposition ("Circuit analysis hits a wall when features are in [superposition](/topics/superposition/)")
4. Block 4 -> Block 5: sae-variants-and-evaluation links to activation-engineering ("Beyond SAEs, [activation engineering](/topics/activation-engineering/) offers a different approach to manipulating representations")
5. Block 5 -> Block 6: function-vectors links to transcoders ("For interpretable MLP replacements, see [transcoders](/topics/transcoders/)")
6. Block 6 -> Block 7: circuit-tracing links to sleeper-agent-detection ("These tools find safety applications in [detecting sleeper agents](/topics/sleeper-agent-detection/)")
7. Block 7 -> Block 8: mi-safety-limitations links to open-problems-methods ("These limitations define the [open problems](/topics/open-problems-methods/) the field must solve")
8. course-synthesis links to all major landmarks: attention-mechanism, induction-heads, activation-patching, superposition, sparse-autoencoders, circuit-tracing, refusal-direction

Only add links that feel natural in context. Do not force links where they do not fit the narrative flow.
  </action>
  <verify>
Search all articles for cross-block links:
```bash
grep -r "/topics/" src/topics/*/index.md | grep -v "images/" | wc -l
```
Expect at least 50 cross-article links across the full set. Run `npx @11ty/eleventy --dryrun` to confirm no build errors after edits.
  </verify>
  <done>Cross-block links added where they naturally fit. The full article set is interconnected with navigable cross-references.</done>
</task>

# Phase 5.1 Plan 12: Cross-Link Audit and Final Verification Summary

**All 35 articles verified clean across 7 audit dimensions, 5 cross-block navigation links added connecting every adjacent block pair**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~6 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-04T15:27:28Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-04T15:33:49Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 5

## Accomplishments

- Comprehensive audit of all 35 articles: existence, front matter, cross-links, citations, diagrams, content quality -- all passed
- Added 5 cross-block navigation links: Block 1->2, 4->5, 5->6, 6->7, and capstone induction-heads link
- Full Eleventy build succeeds producing 37 HTML pages with zero errors
- 176 total cross-article links across the site (well above 50 minimum)
- All 27 PNG diagrams verified placed and referenced with Figure captions
- All 44 citation keys verified against references.json
- Every article confirmed: 2 pause-and-think prompts, 2+ sidenotes, no Typst remnants

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Verify all articles, fix cross-links and front matter** - No commit needed (audit found zero issues)
2. **Task 2: Add missing cross-links between blocks** - `7ebce61` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/topics/attention-mechanism/index.md` - Added cross-link to what-is-mech-interp (Block 1 -> Block 2)
- `src/topics/sae-variants-and-evaluation/index.md` - Added cross-link to activation-engineering (Block 4 -> Block 5)
- `src/topics/function-vectors/index.md` - Added cross-link to transcoders (Block 5 -> Block 6)
- `src/topics/circuit-tracing/index.md` - Added cross-link to sleeper-agent-detection (Block 6 -> Block 7)
- `src/topics/course-synthesis/index.md` - Added induction-heads to capstone synthesis

## Audit Results

| Check | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Existence | PASS | 35/35 articles with index.md |
| learningPath.json sync | PASS | All 35 slugs match |
| Front matter | PASS | title, description, prerequisites, difficulty, block, category present in all |
| Cross-links | PASS | All /topics/SLUG/ links resolve (176 total) |
| Citations | PASS | All cite keys found in references.json |
| Diagrams | PASS | 27/27 PNGs placed and referenced |
| Content quality | PASS | 2 pause-and-think per article, 2+ sidenotes, no Typst remnants |
| Build | PASS | 37 files written, zero errors |

## Cross-Block Links Status

| Connection | Status | Link Location |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| Block 1 -> Block 2 | Added | attention-mechanism -> what-is-mech-interp |
| Block 2 -> Block 3 | Already existed | logit-lens-and-probing -> activation-patching |
| Block 3 -> Block 4 | Already existed | circuit-evaluation -> superposition |
| Block 4 -> Block 5 | Added | sae-variants-and-evaluation -> activation-engineering |
| Block 5 -> Block 6 | Added | function-vectors -> transcoders |
| Block 6 -> Block 7 | Added | circuit-tracing -> sleeper-agent-detection |
| Block 7 -> Block 8 | Already existed | mi-safety-limitations -> open-problems-methods |
| Capstone cross-links | Enhanced | course-synthesis -> induction-heads (added to existing 10 cross-links) |

## Decisions Made

- No fixes were needed from the audit: all 35 articles passed every verification check
- Cross-block links added only where they fit natural narrative flow (5 of 8 planned links were missing; 3 already existed)

## Deviations from Plan

None -- plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## User Setup Required

None -- no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- **Phase 5.1 complete:** All 35 articles written, verified, and interconnected
- **Full site builds cleanly:** 37 HTML pages, zero errors
- **Ready for deployment or next phase:** Complete MI learning resource covering 16-week curriculum
- **No blockers:** All content migrated from Typst source material

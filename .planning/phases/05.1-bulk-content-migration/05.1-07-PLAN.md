<objective>
Create Block 5 Part 1: the steering and circuit-tracing articles from Weeks 12-13, each with 3 diagrams.

Purpose: These advanced topics represent the frontier of MI research. Steering shows how MI enables model control; circuit tracing shows how to discover full computational graphs at scale. Both are active research areas with major 2024-2025 publications.
Output: 2 new articles with 6 diagrams total

Convert week-12.typ (940 lines) into a narrative article. Week 12 covers:

1. **Activation Addition (ActAdd)** - Turner et al.: adding a steering vector to residual stream activations at inference time. Computing steering vectors from contrastive pairs. The "love - hate" example.

2. **Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA)** - Panickssery et al.: computing steering vectors across many contrastive examples, averaging to get a robust direction. Application to sycophancy, hallucination, etc.

3. **Representation Engineering (RepE)** - Zou et al.: a top-down framework for finding and manipulating representations. Reading vectors (probes) and control vectors (steering). Connection to the linear representation hypothesis.

4. **The Refusal Direction** - Arditi et al.: finding a single direction in activation space that mediates refusal behavior. Ablating this direction removes refusal. Implications for safety.

5. **Function Vectors** - Todd et al.: extracting vectors that represent input-output functions (e.g., "capitalize," "translate to French"). Evidence for compositional function representation.

6. **LEACE** - Belrose et al.: Linear Concept Erasure. Perfect linear erasure of a concept from representations. The theoretical bound on what linear methods can remove.

7. **Comparison of Methods** - How these approaches relate. Linear interventions as a unifying theme. Limitations (linear assumption, distributional shift).

Convert week-13.typ (987 lines) into a narrative article. Week 13 covers:

1. **The Evolution of Circuit Analysis** - From manual circuit discovery (IOI) to automated methods. The need for scalable approaches as models get larger.

2. **Attribution Graphs** - Lindsey et al. (2025) and Anthropic's circuit tracing methodology. Nodes as features (SAE latents or attention heads), edges as attribution scores. How to build and prune attribution graphs.

3. **Transcoders** - Dunefsky et al.: an alternative to SAEs that directly maps between layer inputs and outputs. MLP transcoders as a drop-in replacement for MLP layers. How transcoders enable cleaner circuit graphs.

4. **The Biology of an LLM** - Anthropic's (2025) findings from applying circuit tracing to Claude: multi-step reasoning circuits, planning, multilingual features, safety-relevant circuits.

5. **Sparse Feature Circuits** - Marks et al.: combining SAEs with circuit discovery. Finding circuits in the feature basis rather than the neuron basis.

6. **Practical Circuit Tracing** - How to actually do circuit tracing: choosing the right granularity, handling feature splitting, validating discovered circuits.

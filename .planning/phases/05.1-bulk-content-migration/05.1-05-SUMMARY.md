# Phase 5.1 Plan 05: Block 3 Observation to Causation Summary

**Block 3 complete: attribution-patching (gradient approximation + path patching + ACDC), ioi-circuit (IOI task, backward-tracing discovery, 5 head classes), circuit-evaluation (negative/backup name movers, faithfulness/completeness/minimality, causal scrubbing with honest limitations), plus activation-patching pilot reviewed with cross-links**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 6min 5s
- **Started:** 2026-02-04T15:14:34Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-04T15:20:39Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 5

## Accomplishments
- Reviewed activation-patching pilot: updated description to reflect scoped coverage, added forward cross-links to attribution-patching and ioi-circuit articles
- Created attribution-patching article covering gradient approximation, when the linear approximation holds and breaks, path patching for edges vs nodes, and ACDC automated circuit discovery
- Created ioi-circuit article covering the IOI task, the human-readable algorithm, backward-tracing discovery methodology, Name Movers, S-Inhibition Heads, Duplicate Token/Induction Heads, and the three-step algorithm
- Created circuit-evaluation article covering Negative Name Movers (loss hedging), Backup Name Movers (redundancy), full circuit diagram, three evaluation criteria, causal scrubbing with honest limitations, lessons and limitations of circuit analysis
- Copied IOI circuit diagram PNG to ioi-circuit/images/ and referenced it from circuit-evaluation

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Review activation-patching pilot and create attribution-patching article** - `3040bfd` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Create ioi-circuit and circuit-evaluation articles** - `dc4472c` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `src/topics/activation-patching/index.md` - Updated description, added cross-links to attribution-patching and ioi-circuit
- `src/topics/attribution-patching/index.md` - New article: gradient approximation, path patching, ACDC
- `src/topics/ioi-circuit/index.md` - New article: IOI task, discovery, head classes, algorithm
- `src/topics/ioi-circuit/images/ioi_circuit_diagram.png` - Circuit diagram copied from course assets
- `src/topics/circuit-evaluation/index.md` - New article: evaluation criteria, causal scrubbing, limitations

## Decisions Made
- Kept existing attribution/path patching content in the activation-patching pilot (it provides a good introduction) and added cross-links to the new deep-dive article, rather than extracting the content. The pilot's coverage is at primer level, not detailed enough to warrant extraction.
- Placed the IOI circuit diagram in `ioi-circuit/images/` but referenced it from circuit-evaluation, since the full circuit with all 7 classes is discussed in circuit-evaluation. This allows both articles to share the asset.
- Scoped the ioi-circuit article to the core mechanism (4 head classes: Name Movers, S-Inhibition, Duplicate Token, Induction) and circuit-evaluation to the remaining heads (Negative NM, Backup NM, Previous Token) plus the evaluation framework.

## Deviations from Plan

None -- plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## User Setup Required

None -- no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Block 3 complete with 4 articles in the observation-to-causation pathway
- Narrative arc established: patching -> attribution patching -> IOI discovery -> evaluation framework
- Forward links to superposition and sparse-autoencoders articles (Block 4) already present in circuit-evaluation
- Ready for Plans 06-07 (Block 4: superposition and feature extraction)

<objective>
Create Block 5 Part 2 and Block 6 Part 1: the model-diffing-universality article (Week 14) and the mi-safety article (Week 15).

Purpose: These articles cover how MI extends beyond single models (comparing models, multimodal) and how MI contributes to AI safety (the field's primary motivation). Both bridge from technical methods to broader implications.
Output: 2 new articles with 5 diagrams total
</objective>

Convert week-14.typ (932 lines) into a narrative article. Week 14 covers three related topics -- the connecting theme is "extending MI beyond a single model":

1. **Crosscoders and Model Diffing** - Using SAE-like architectures across model pairs (base vs chat, different checkpoints). Finding shared and unique features between models. Understanding what RLHF/fine-tuning changes.

2. **Universality** - The hypothesis that different models learn similar representations and circuits. Gurnee et al.'s evidence for universal neurons. Convergent features across architectures. Limitations: when universality breaks down.

3. **Multimodal Mechanistic Interpretability** - Extending MI to vision-language models. What changes when models process images and text together. Lin et al.'s survey of multimodal MI techniques. Early findings and open questions.

Content guidelines:
- Cite: gurnee2024universal, lin2025multimodal (in references.json)
- The three sub-topics (crosscoders, universality, multimodal) are loosely connected. Use the theme of "extending MI beyond single models" as a unifying narrative thread.
- 2 pause-and-think prompts
- 2-4 sidenotes
- Cross-link to sparse-autoencoders (SAE basis for crosscoders), circuit-tracing (circuit comparison across models)
- Cross-link to what-is-mech-interp (universality introduced conceptually)
- Target 1,500-2,500 words

Convert week-15.typ (1051 lines) into a narrative article. Week 15 covers:

1. **MI's Role in AI Safety** - Why MI matters for alignment. The case for understanding models before trusting them. MI as a tool for verifying alignment claims.

2. **Sleeper Agents** - Hubinger et al. (2024): training models with hidden behaviors that activate under specific conditions. Demonstrating that standard safety training does not remove deceptive behaviors.

3. **Alignment Faking** - Greenblatt et al. (2024): models strategically appearing aligned during evaluation while preserving misaligned goals. The measurement problem for alignment.

4. **Probing for Deception** - Anthropic's work on using probes (simple classifiers on activations) to detect when models are being deceptive. Catching sleeper agents through internal representations rather than behavioral tests.

5. **Safety Applications Overview** - Trojan detection, monitoring for deception, understanding failure modes, auditing model behavior. How MI techniques (SAEs, patching, probing) apply to each safety problem.

6. **Limitations of MI for Safety** - Current capabilities vs. what safety would require. The gap between understanding toy models and frontier systems. Whether MI can keep pace with model scaling.

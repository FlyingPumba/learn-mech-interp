<objective>
Create all 5 articles in Block 5 (Representation Engineering & Steering) from Week 12: activation-engineering, representation-engineering, refusal-direction, concept-erasure, and function-vectors.

Purpose: Block 5 covers the representation engineering paradigm -- steering model behavior by manipulating internal representations, with the refusal direction as the key case study.
Output: 5 new articles + 3 diagrams from Week 12.

Create `src/topics/activation-engineering/index.md` from Week 12 sections 2-3. Cover:

- Activation Engineering and ActAdd: the paradigm of adding steering vectors to activations during inference
- The ActAdd method (Turner et al.): computing a steering vector from contrastive prompt pairs, adding it at inference time
- The math: $\mathbf{h}'_l = \mathbf{h}_l + \alpha \cdot \mathbf{v}$ where $\mathbf{v}$ is the steering vector
- Key properties: no fine-tuning needed, layer-specific effects, the importance of choosing the right layer
- Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA): Panickssery et al.'s improvement using multiple prompt pairs averaged over a dataset
- CAA results: sycophancy steering, additivity of steering vectors
- Place the steering comparison diagram

Front matter:
```yaml
title: "Activation Engineering: ActAdd and Contrastive Activation Addition"

**Article B: representation-engineering**

Create `src/topics/representation-engineering/index.md` from Week 12 section 4. Cover:

- The RepE paradigm shift: from individual features to representation-level analysis
- Two components: Representation Reading (Linear Artificial Tomography / LAT) and Representation Control
- LAT: reading internal representations using contrastive pairs and PCA/mean-difference
- Representation Control: using the read directions to steer behavior
- Safety applications: honesty, fairness, harmlessness directions
- How ActAdd and CAA fit within the RepE framework (they are specific instances)

Front matter:
```yaml

**Article A: refusal-direction**

cp /Users/ivan/latex/mech-interp-course/week-12/assets/refusal_direction_schematic.png src/topics/refusal-direction/images/
```

Create `src/topics/refusal-direction/index.md` from Week 12 sections 5-6. Cover:

- The Refusal Direction hypothesis: a single direction in activation space mediates refusal behavior
- Computing the direction: mean difference between harmful and harmless prompt activations
- Connection to CAA methodology
- The Refusal Direction Experiment:
  - Ablation: removing the refusal direction removes refusal behavior
  - Addition: adding the direction makes the model refuse benign requests
  - Capability preservation: the model retains general capabilities after ablation
  - Dual-use implications: this is a jailbreak technique
- Place both diagrams with Figure captions

**Article B: concept-erasure**

Create `src/topics/concept-erasure/index.md` from Week 12 section 7. Cover:

- LEACE: the complement to steering -- instead of adding a direction, erasing it completely
- The mathematical guarantee: LEACE projects activations to remove all linear information about a concept
- Concept scrubbing: applying LEACE to remove specific concepts from representations
- The complete representation engineering toolkit: reading (probes), adding (steering), erasing (LEACE)

**Article C: function-vectors**

Create `src/topics/function-vectors/index.md` from Week 12 section 8. Cover:

- Function Vectors: from engineered directions to naturally occurring task directions
- What function vectors are: directions extracted from in-context learning examples that encode the "function" (e.g., "translate to French", "capitalize")
- Robustness: function vectors transfer across different inputs
- Composability: combining function vectors combines their effects
- The significance: the model naturally represents tasks as directions, not just concepts

Front matter:
```yaml
title: "Function Vectors"
description: "How in-context learning examples create natural directions in activation space that encode entire tasks, showing that models represent functions, not just features."

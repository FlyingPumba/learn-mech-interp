# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-02)

**Core value:** People can learn Mechanistic Interpretability through well-structured, readable articles that build from foundations to frontier research, with easy navigation between topics and direct links to source papers.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Foundation & Deployment

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 7 (Foundation & Deployment)
Plan: 1 of TBD in current phase
Status: In progress

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 7 phases derived from 46 v1 requirements, foundation-first approach per research recommendations
- [Roadmap]: Content authoring phase (Phase 4) deliberately placed after rendering engine (Phase 3) so pilot articles can validate all content types
- [01-01]: Use EleventyHtmlBasePlugin with plain absolute URLs instead of url filter to avoid double pathPrefix
- [01-01]: Directory data files (topics.11tydata.js) for layout/permalink inheritance pattern established

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 4 is highest risk: Typst-to-article conversion is editorial work that may take 2-4x expected time per research findings
- Requirements doc claims 41 requirements but actual count is 46; traceability table corrected during roadmap creation

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 7 phases derived from 46 v1 requirements, foundation-first approach per research recommendations
- [Roadmap]: Content authoring phase (Phase 4) deliberately placed after rendering engine (Phase 3) so pilot articles can validate all content types

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 4 is highest risk: Typst-to-article conversion is editorial work that may take 2-4x expected time per research findings
- Requirements doc claims 41 requirements but actual count is 46; traceability table corrected during roadmap creation

## Session Continuity
